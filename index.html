Then, we create a binomial distribution with n=100 and p=0.5, which is a random distribution with equal probability of positive or negative outcomes. We use this distribution to redistribute the impact scores so that they are skewed towards -1 for negative events and towards +1 for positive events. This results in the redistributed impact score range for each event/disease.</p></div>
<ol><li><p>Historian estimates of WWI deaths range from about 5M (Urlanis) to over 13M (Ferguson) including war casualties, post-war aftermath, and war-exacerbated disease/famine.

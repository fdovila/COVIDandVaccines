        <h2>Event and Disease Impact Calculation</h2>
                <p>To calculate the redistributed impact score range, we first take the average of the adjusted impact score range for each event/disease. Then, we create a binomial distribution with n=100 and p=0.5, which is a random distribution with equal probability of positive or negative outcomes. We use this distribution to redistribute the impact scores so that they are skewed towards -1 for negative events and towards +1 for positive events. This results in the redistributed impact score range for each event/disease.</p>

Cost estimates for vaccines range from $5-15 per dose (low to high-income countries) and 15-30 billion total doses are needed for 70-95% global coverage.
